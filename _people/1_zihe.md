## Education

PhD, Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 2018

MS, Physics, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 2012

BS, Physics, Nanjing University, 2011


## Short Bio

I obtained my PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the supervision of [Prof. Kent Choquette](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/choquett). My doctoral dissertation focuses on Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) and coupled VCSEL arrays. After that, I was recruited by Meta (Facebook Reality Labs, AR/VR) to work on ultra-miniaturized structured-light projectors and 3D vision systems. In 2020, I returned to academia as a postdoctoral researcher in [Prof. Liang Feng's lab](https://fenglab.seas.upenn.edu/index.html) at the University of Pennsylvania where I worked on topological photonics and quantum optics. Since August 2023, I've been an assistant professor at Auburn ECE.


## Research Interests

My research interests emcompass optics, microelectronics, and physics. I had most of fun when I got to use all three of them. A significant portion of my past research has been devoted to the control of collective behaviors in multi-element and multimode photonic systems to build scalable and programmable integrated photonic chips for both classical and quantum applications.
