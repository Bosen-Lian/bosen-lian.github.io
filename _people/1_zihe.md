## Short Bio

I got my PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, under the supervision of [Prof. Kent Choquette](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/choquett). My doctoral dissertation focuses on Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) and coupled VCSEL arrays. After that I was recruited by Meta (Facebook Reality Labs, AR/VR) to work on ultra-miniaturized structured-light projectors and 3D vision systems. In 2020 I came back to the academia as a postdoc in [Prof. Liang Feng's lab](https://fenglab.seas.upenn.edu/index.html) at Penn and worked on topological photonics and quantum optics. I've been an assistant professor at Auburn ECE since Aug 2023.
