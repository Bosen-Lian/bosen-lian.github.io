## Education

PhD, Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington, 2021

MS, System Analysis and Integration, Northeastern University (Shenyang), 2018

BS, Statistics, North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, 2015


## Short Bio

I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Arlington under the supervision of [Prof. Frank L. Lewis](https://www.uta.edu/academics/faculty/profile?username=flewis). From Dec. 2021 to Aug. 2023, I continued my research as a postdoctoral researcher working with Prof. Lewis and [Prof. Ali Davoudi](https://www.uta.edu/academics/faculty/profile?username=davoudi). During the same period, I was appointed as an adjunct professor teaching control engineering courses at UT Arlington. Since August 2023, I've been an assistant professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Auburn University.


## Research Interests

My research interests emcompass optics, microelectronics, and physics. I had most of fun when I got to use all three of them. A significant portion of my past research has been devoted to the control of collective behaviors in multi-element and multimode photonic systems to build scalable and programmable integrated photonic chips for both classical and quantum applications (dynamically steerable laser sources, reconfigurable quantum optical sources, etc.).
