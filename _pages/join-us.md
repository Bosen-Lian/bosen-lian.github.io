We are looking for motivated students who are interested in doing research on photonic devices and sensing/imaging systems.
At the moment, we are hiring at all levels (**undergraduate**, **master**, **PhD**, and **postdoc** positions, all fully funded). We also welcome summer interns.

If you are interested in at least 2 out of the following 3 catagories of work, you might find our research a good fit for you. 
- Coding and prototyping (designing both hardware and software to build prototype sensing systems)
- Physics (optics, electromagnetics, quantum, etc.)
- Microfabrication (working in the cleanroom, fabricating semiconductor chips)


If you are interested in joining the lab, please send me an <a href="mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}" title="email">email <i class="fas fa-envelope"></i></a> with your CV and a brief statement of interest.

For potential graduate students, Spring 2024 and Fall 2024 applications are welcome.
