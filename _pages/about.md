We develop next-generation *photonic devices and systems* for *imaging*, *communications*, and *computing*.

Photons are the ultimate carriers of information, serving as our primary means of perceiving the world and transmitting information, both organically through our own eyes and technologically via optical fibers, cameras, sensors, and machine vision. Next-generation technologies, such as wearable and implantable devices as well as autonomous systems, impose stringent demands (e.g., size, weight, and power) that traditional optical systems are unable to fulfill. Our work navigates three transformative directions that hold potential for significant technological breakthroughs: 
- **Novel optical sources (distributed, ultrafast, reconfigurable)**
- **Meta-optics with information processing capabilities**
- **Quantum-enhanced optical sensing and imaging**

Leveraging heterogeneously integrated photonic and microelectronic chips, the devices and systems that we investigate offer ultimate compactness, superior system stability, and scalable manufacturability.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
