Our research efforts are in distributed estimation, distributed control, reinforcement learning, game theory, and their intersections in cyber-physical feedback systems. Our primary objective is to design safe, optimal, and resilient multiagent systems and games and to solve data-driven control solutions, supported by rigorous provable analysis. Furthermore, we maintain a keen interest in the practical application of robotic platforms, spanning robot arms, unmanned vehicles, sensor networks, and more.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
